I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Dhaka. I graduated in 2023.

I worked as a data engineer in Enosis Solutions, Dhaka for one and a half years right after my graduation.

My research interests are automated vehicles, reinforcement learning, cyber-physical systems and robotics. I am working as a research assistant under the supervision of Professor Dr. Md. Abdur Razzaque in Green Networking Research (GNR) Group of University of Dhaka since my undergraduate days. My current goal is to join a top university as a CS PhD student, and make meaningful contributions in my research fields.

I have published a [journal paper](https://sbrotee63.github.io/publication/2024-UAV_UGV_Coalition_MADRL_Hybrid) in Ad Hoc Networks, Elsevier in 2024.
