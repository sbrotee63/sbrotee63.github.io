I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Dhaka. I graduated in 2023.

I worked as a data engineer in Enosis Solutions, Dhaka for one and a half years right after my graduation.

My research interests lie in automated vehicles, deep reinforcement learning, cyber-physical systems, internet of things, and robotics.

I have been working as a research assistant under the supervision of Professor Dr. Md. Abdur Razzaque in Green Networking Research (GNR) Group since my undergraduate days. My current goal is to pursue a suitable CS PhD degree to fulfill my dream of becoming a proficient CS researcher, and make meaningful contributions towards my research fields.

I have published a [journal paper](https://sbrotee63.github.io/publication/2024-UAV_UGV_Coalition_MADRL_Hybrid) in Ad Hoc Networks, Elsevier in 2024.
