I am a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) graduate from the University of Dhaka, class of 2023. I worked as a data engineer in Enosis Solutions for one and a half year right after my graduation. I have been working as a research assistant in Green Networking Research (GNR) Group under the supervision of Professor Dr. Md. Abdur Razzaque since my undergraduate days.

Currently, I am looking for PhD opportunities starting in Fall 2025.

My research interests lie in automated vehicles, deep reinforcement learning, cyber-physical systems, internet of things, systems security, and robotics. My current objective is to pursue a suitable CS PhD degree to fulfill my dream of becoming a proficient CS researcher, and make meaningful contributions towards my research fields.

I am a good problem-solver whoâ€™s always willing to learn more. I have a great capability in performing well under pressure within time constraints and can deliver results within tight deadlines.
